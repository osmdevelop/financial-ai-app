Implement “Save & Share Daily Brief” (v1).
This adds an exportable, shareable snapshot of the Daily Brief in a clean format.

Constraints:
- No authentication
- No backend changes required
- No paid services
- Keep UI minimal and consistent
- Export must work with local-only data (mock/partial supported)
- Do NOT export any private keys or sensitive info (none exists)
- Must include tests + data-testid

============================================================
GOAL
============================================================
1) Add a “Share” button to the Daily Brief page that exports the brief as:
   - PNG image (required)
   - (Optional) PDF later; not in this prompt unless trivial
2) The export should include:
   - App name + date + time + timezone
   - Today’s Market Call
   - What Changed (max 3 bullets or “No major changes”)
   - Lens Impact (or “Add focus assets”)
   - Headlines That Matter (max 3)
   - What to Watch Next (1 item)
   - DataStatus summary (Live/Mock/Partial + timestamp)
   - Informational disclaimer line
3) The exported image should be:
   - Clean, high-contrast, readable
   - Uses a dedicated “ShareCard” layout optimized for screenshot
   - Always includes mock/partial labels if applicable

============================================================
IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
============================================================
A) Create a dedicated component:
- <DailyBriefShareCard />
- It renders the same brief content but in a fixed-width layout (e.g. 900px),
  optimized for image export.
- It should accept data props (no fetching inside).

B) Rendering strategy:
- When user clicks “Share”:
  1) Render DailyBriefShareCard inside a hidden/offscreen container
  2) Use a client-side DOM-to-image approach to export PNG:
     - Prefer a lightweight library already available in project
     - If not available, add one common choice (html-to-image or dom-to-image)
  3) Download the PNG (filename: OSMFin_DailyBrief_YYYY-MM-DD.png)

C) Add a small toast after export:
- “Daily Brief exported”

D) Add “Copy text summary” secondary action:
- Copies a short plaintext version to clipboard:
  - Date
  - Market call
  - 3 key drivers
  - Watch next
  - Data status

============================================================
UI CHANGES (DAILY BRIEF)
============================================================
- Add a “Share” button near the top-right of Daily Brief (or near AI summary toggle).
- Add a dropdown menu:
  - “Export as Image”
  - “Copy Text Summary”
- Add data-testid:
  - daily-brief-share
  - daily-brief-export-image
  - daily-brief-copy-text

============================================================
SHARE CARD DESIGN (STRICT)
============================================================
The exported card should include the following sections (in order):
1) Header row: “OSM Fin — Daily Brief” + Date + Time
2) Market Call row with badge (Green/Yellow/Red)
3) What Changed (3 bullets max; else “No major changes”)
4) Lens Impact (2 bullets max; else prompt)
5) Headlines That Matter (3 max, each with tag)
6) Watch Next (1 item)
7) Footer row:
   - DataStatusBadge summary (Live/Mock/Partial)
   - “As of …”
   - “Informational only. Not investment advice.”

No charts. No long text. No scrolling.

============================================================
ERROR HANDLING
============================================================
- If export fails, show toast: “Export failed. Try again.”
- If data is missing, render placeholders gracefully.
- If content is mock/partial, show clear label in both UI and export.

============================================================
TESTS
============================================================
Add tests (RTL/Vitest):
1) Daily Brief shows Share button and menu items.
2) Clicking “Copy Text Summary” calls clipboard API with expected content (mock clipboard).
3) Export flow:
   - Mock the image export function and assert it’s called with the ShareCard node.
4) DataStatus label is present on ShareCard when meta.isMock or partial.

============================================================
DONE WHEN
============================================================
- User can export a clean PNG of the Daily Brief.
- User can copy a concise text version to clipboard.
- Export includes date/time and data status labels.
- Works with live/mock/partial data without crashing.
- Tests pass.
