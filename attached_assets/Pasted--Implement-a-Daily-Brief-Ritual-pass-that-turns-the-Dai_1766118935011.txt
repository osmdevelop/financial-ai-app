 Implement a “Daily Brief Ritual” pass that turns
the Daily Brief into the canonical, habit-forming entry point of the app.

This prompt is about PRODUCT EXPERIENCE, not new data or features.

============================================================
GOAL
============================================================
Make Daily Brief the one page a trader opens once per day to answer:

1) Do I need to trade today?
2) What changed since yesterday?
3) What matters specifically for MY focus assets?
4) What should I watch next?

The page must be:
- Short
- Opinionated
- Lens-first
- Calm (reduce noise)
- Consistent every day

============================================================
SCOPE
============================================================
Modify ONLY the Daily Brief page and routing behavior.
Do NOT add new APIs or data sources.
Reuse:
- Market Regime Snapshot
- Trader Lens context
- Policy + Sentiment + Volatility data
- Headlines + Events already available

============================================================
STEP 1 — MAKE DAILY BRIEF THE DEFAULT ENTRY
============================================================
- Update routing so app opens on /daily-brief by default.
- Keep Dashboard accessible, but not the landing page.
- Sidebar: visually highlight “Daily Brief” as primary (subtle dot or label).

============================================================
STEP 2 — DAILY BRIEF STRUCTURE (STRICT)
============================================================

Rebuild the page into EXACTLY these sections, top to bottom:

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1 — TODAY’S MARKET CALL (HERO)
------------------------------------------------------------
Big, bold, single sentence.

Examples:
- “Conditions are mixed — selective trading only.”
- “Risk-off regime — caution across most assets.”
- “Risk-on with low volatility — favorable conditions.”

Rules:
- Generated deterministically from:
  - Market regime
  - Volatility
  - Policy shock state
  - Trader Lens exposure
- NO AI here.
- Add small badge:
  - Green / Yellow / Red (reuse Should I Trade Today logic)
- data-testid="daily-call"

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2 — WHAT CHANGED (OR DIDN’T)
------------------------------------------------------------
Only show if something changed since yesterday.

Examples:
- “Fed tone shifted from Neutral → Hawkish”
- “Policy risk increased due to tariff headlines”
- “Volatility compressed while sentiment improved”

If NOTHING changed:
- Show exactly:
  “No major regime changes since yesterday.”

Rules:
- Max 3 bullets.
- Derived from Market Regime Snapshot diff logic.
- data-testid="daily-changes"

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3 — YOUR LENS IMPACT
------------------------------------------------------------
Lens-only section. If no focus assets exist, show a prompt to add them.

Content:
- One sentence:
  “Your focus assets are currently most exposed to:”
- Then 1–2 bullets:
  - “Policy risk via FXI”
  - “Volatility via QQQ”

Rules:
- Pull from Trader Lens context.
- No charts.
- No prices.
- data-testid="lens-impact"

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4 — HEADLINES THAT MATTER (MAX 3)
------------------------------------------------------------
Show only lens-relevant headlines.

Each item:
- Title
- Source
- Tiny tag: Policy / Macro / Earnings
- Optional confidence indicator

Rules:
- Hard cap: 3 headlines.
- No scrolling inside this section.
- Add “View all lens headlines” link.
- data-testid="lens-headlines"

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5 — WHAT TO WATCH NEXT
------------------------------------------------------------
One upcoming catalyst.

Examples:
- “Tomorrow’s CPI print — impacts rate-sensitive assets.”
- “Fed speaker later today — could shift tone.”

Rules:
- Choose highest relevance to lens if possible.
- Only ONE item.
- data-testid="watch-next"

------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6 — AI SUMMARY (OPTIONAL, COLLAPSIBLE)
------------------------------------------------------------
Collapsed by default.

Button: “Read AI summary”
Expands to a 4–5 sentence summary:
- Uses existing AI pipeline
- Must follow structure:
  - Context
  - Change
  - Lens impact
  - Risk note
  - What could change

Rules:
- No predictions
- No advice
- Professional tone

data-testid="ai-summary"

============================================================
STEP 3 — COPY & LANGUAGE PASS
============================================================
Rewrite all Daily Brief copy to:
- Sound like a senior trader / strategist
- Avoid hype words (“explosive”, “massive”, etc.)
- Prefer calm, factual language

Examples:
GOOD:
- “Conditions favor caution.”
BAD:
- “Markets look dangerous today.”

============================================================
STEP 4 — UX & GUARDRAILS
============================================================
- Add “Informational only” banner (subtle, non-intrusive).
- Show data freshness timestamp at bottom.
- If data is mock or partial:
  - Show one-line note: “Some inputs unavailable — view with caution.”

============================================================
STEP 5 — TESTS
============================================================
Add tests for:
- Daily Brief renders all sections in order.
- “No major changes” message appears when applicable.
- Lens Impact section hides when no focus assets exist.
- Headlines capped at 3.
- AI Summary collapsed by default.
- data-testid coverage for all sections.

============================================================
DONE WHEN
============================================================
- App opens to Daily Brief.
- A trader can read the entire page in under 60 seconds.
- Page answers “Should I trade today?” without scrolling.
- Daily Brief feels like a *daily ritual*, not a dashboard.
