You are my senior engineer. Policy infrastructure is now fully implemented
(policy pages, alerts, snapshot card, policy chips, AI Insights context, etc.).

Your next task is to integrate policy intelligence deeper into Portfolio,
Asset Overview, and AI Insights templates.

Implement ONLY these 3 features (no new routes or endpoints):

============================================================
1) PORTFOLIO — POLICY EXPOSURE CARD
============================================================

Goal:
Show portfolio-level exposure to policy-sensitive assets.

Data:
Use existing getTrumpIndex() to retrieve sensitiveAssets and their sensitivity/betas.

Frontend:
On /portfolio page, create a new component:
- PolicyExposureCard
  - Calculate:
    * total holdings count
    * number and % that appear in sensitiveAssets
  - Show:
    * Ring chart or small bar:
      “Policy Exposure: X% High, Y% Moderate, Z% Low”
    * Top 3 policy-sensitive holdings with sensitivity chips
    * If 0 exposure: message “Your portfolio currently has low policy sensitivity.”

Attach this card below the main portfolio metrics, using same styling as other cards.

For holdings table:
- Add a small policy icon next to asset symbol if it appears in sensitiveAssets.
- Tooltip: “Policy-sensitive asset”.

============================================================
2) ASSET OVERVIEW — POLICY IMPACT PANEL
============================================================

Goal:
When viewing an asset in Asset Overview, show its policy relevance.

In the Asset Overview page:
- Detect if current symbol exists in TrumpIndex.sensitiveAssets.
- Create PolicyImpactPanel:

  If asset is sensitive:
    - Show sensitivity badge (High/Moderate/Low)
    - List relevant topics (combine:
        * clusters[].topics where newsIds include that asset’s ticker
        * or topics from backend if attached to headline metadata)
    - Show last 2–3 policy-related headlines for this asset
    - AI mini-summary:
        Call small on-device prompt using the existing AI Insights endpoint:
        Provide:
          * asset name
          * sensitivity level
          * relevant topics
          * lastChangePct
        1–2 sentences:
        “This asset historically reacts strongly to tariff/defense headlines.
         Today’s policy tone may increase volatility.”

  If not sensitive:
    - Simple text: “No significant policy sensitivity detected.”

Reuse existing Card, Chip, Badge components.

============================================================
3) AI INSIGHTS — NEW POLICY TEMPLATES
============================================================

Goal:
Expose policy-aware actions as preset prompts.

In /insights page:
Add 3 template buttons in the same style as existing templates:

  A) “How did policy affect my portfolio today?”
     Pre-fill:
     “Explain how today’s Trump Index movement, Fedspeak tone,
      and policy-sensitive assets may have contributed to my portfolio’s performance.”

  B) “Explain my policy-sensitive holdings”
     Pre-fill:
     “Review my policy-sensitive assets and explain which policy themes
      (tariffs, trade, defense, immigration) are most relevant.”

  C) “Is Fed tone influencing markets today?”
     Pre-fill:
     “Analyze the current Fedspeak tone and whether it aligns with
      today’s market moves in equities, crypto, and rates.”

Ensure:
- Each template still uses the globally injected policy context.
- Null-safe: if policy context missing, Insights should still work.

============================================================
UX, TESTING & INTEGRATION
============================================================

- Portfolio page: Test that PolicyExposureCard renders with mock data.
- Asset Overview: Test detection of sensitive assets and rendering of PolicyImpactPanel.
- Insights: Test that clicking template buttons inserts the correct full prompt value.

Style:
Match existing cards and chip styles.
Respect dark/light theme.

No new backend endpoints required.
Use only existing getTrumpIndex(), getFedspeak(),
and the AI Insights endpoint.

============================================================
DONE WHEN
============================================================
- Portfolio shows a Policy Exposure card with correct percentages and sensitivity breakdown.
- Portfolio holdings display a small policy icon for sensitive tickers.
- Asset Overview shows a clear Policy Impact panel for sensitive assets.
- Insights page displays three new template buttons pre-filled with policy questions.
- All features work with real and mock policy data.
