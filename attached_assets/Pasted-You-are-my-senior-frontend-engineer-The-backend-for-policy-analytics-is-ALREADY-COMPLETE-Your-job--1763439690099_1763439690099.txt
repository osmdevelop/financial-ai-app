You are my senior frontend engineer. The backend for policy analytics is ALREADY COMPLETE. Your job is to build the Policy UI and route only.

========================================
CONTEXT (IMPORTANT)
========================================
Already implemented and working:

- Backend services:
  - /api/policy/trump-index
  - /api/policy/fedspeak

- TypeScript client & schemas (already exist):
  - getTrumpIndex(): Promise<TrumpIndexResponse>
  - getFedspeak(): Promise<FedspeakResponse>
  - TrumpIndexResponse contains:
    - index: { value: number; zScore: number; regime: "Risk-On" | "Neutral" | "Risk-Off"; asOf: string }
    - history: Array<{ date: string; zScore: number }>
    - sensitiveAssets: Array<{
        symbol: string;
        name: string;
        category: string;        // e.g. "USD", "Defense ETF", "China ADR", "Oil"
        correlation: number;     // -1..1
        rollingImpact: number;   // recent % or bp impact
        lastChangePct: number;   // today's change %
      }>
    - recentNews: Array<{
        id: string;
        title: string;
        url: string;
        publishedAt: string;
        source: string;
        topics: string[];        // e.g. ["Tariffs", "China", "Defense"]
        intensity: number;       // 0..1
        summary?: string;
      }>

  - FedspeakResponse contains:
    - tone: {
        current: "Hawkish" | "Dovish" | "Neutral";
        score: number;           // e.g. -1..1 or 0..100
        rolling7d: Array<{ date: string; score: number }>
      }
    - quotes: Array<{
        id: string;
        speaker: string;
        role?: string;
        date: string;
        excerpt: string;
        impliedOdds?: string;    // textual description of odds / path
        source: string;
        url: string;
      }>
    - asOf: string

ASSUME these shapes if not already exact; wire to whatever types are present but keep the spirit.

The frontend stack:
- React + TypeScript
- React Router (App.tsx controls routes)
- Existing pages live under /client/src/pages (e.g. Dashboard, Portfolio, etc.)
- Styling: use the same design system and styling approach as existing pages (Tailwind or CSS modules, reuse any shared components like Card, Badge, Table, Skeleton, ErrorState, etc.)
- Charting: use the same chart library already in the project (likely Recharts). Do NOT introduce a new chart library.

========================================
TASK
========================================
Create a full-featured **Policy** page and route:

- New route: /policy
- New page component: /client/src/pages/policy.tsx
- Use existing API client functions getTrumpIndex() and getFedspeak()
- Provide:
  1) Trump Index visualization (z-score chart, current regime)
  2) Sensitive assets table
  3) Policy news feed (topics + intensity)
  4) Fedspeak tone meter
  5) Fed quotes section
- Implement loading + error states consistent with the rest of the app.
- Add basic tests for data fetch/render behavior (use existing test stack: e.g. Vitest/Jest + React Testing Library).

========================================
UI REQUIREMENTS
========================================

PAGE LAYOUT
- Title in header: "Policy & Political Indexes"
- Optional subtitle: "Trump Index, Fedspeak tone, and policy-driven asset sensitivities."
- Layout: two main vertical sections stacked:
  - Section 1: Trump Index
  - Section 2: Fedspeak
- Page should be responsive and match the look & feel of Dashboard / Headlines pages.

SECTION 1: TRUMP INDEX
A) Summary header
- Card showing:
  - Current Trump Index z-score (large number, e.g. +1.2 or -0.8)
  - Regime pill: "Elevated Policy Risk", "Normal", etc. Derive from zScore:
    - z > +0.75 → "High Policy Risk"
    - -0.75 <= z <= +0.75 → "Normal"
    - z < -0.75 → "Muted Policy Risk"
  - As-of timestamp (formatted, e.g. “As of Aug 20, 15:32 UTC”)
- Use color coding consistent with theme:
  - High risk → warm (red/orange)
  - Normal → neutral
  - Muted → cool (green/blue)

B) Z-Score Trend Chart
- Line chart of history (7–30 days, depending on available data).
- X-axis: date; Y-axis: zScore.
- Show a horizontal zero line.
- Hover tooltip: date + zScore.
- Add a small legend or label: “Trump Policy Index (z-score, 0 = average)”.

C) Sensitive Assets Table
- Table columns:
  - Asset (symbol + name)
  - Category (e.g. “USD”, “Defense ETF”, “China ADR”, “Energy”)
  - Correlation (formatted as e.g. “0.72”)
  - Rolling impact (e.g. “+0.8% last 7d on policy events”)
  - Today’s change (lastChangePct)
- Sort the table by |correlation| descending by default.
- If there is a route for Asset Overview (e.g. /asset/:symbol), make the symbol clickable to navigate there.

D) Trump Policy News Feed
- Panel listing recentNews from TrumpIndexResponse.
- For each news item:
  - Time ago (e.g. “3h ago”) and source.
  - Title (clickable link → url, open in new tab).
  - Topic chips for topics[].
  - Intensity badge: map intensity 0..1 to Low / Medium / High, with a small bar or colored chip.
  - Optional: show summary snippet if available.
- Add a “Refresh” button at top-right wired to re-call getTrumpIndex().

SECTION 2: FED SPEAK

A) Fedspeak Tone Meter
- Card showing:
  - Current tone: “Hawkish” / “Neutral” / “Dovish”.
  - Tone score visual:
    - Either a horizontal segmented bar or a small gauge where left = Dovish, right = Hawkish.
  - As-of timestamp (from FedspeakResponse).
- Color code consistent with meaning:
  - Hawkish → warmer colors.
  - Dovish → cooler colors.
  - Neutral → grey/neutral.

B) Rolling 7-day Tone Chart
- Line chart of Fedspeak tone rolling7d scores.
- X-axis: date; Y-axis: score (normalized metric, e.g. -1 to +1 or 0–100).
- Draw zero/midline.

C) Fed Quotes Section
- Card listing recent quotes:
  - Show speaker (name + role if available), date, and short excerpt.
  - Under each quote, a small line for impliedOdds text, e.g. “Implied: higher-for-longer odds increased”.
  - Source link to url.
- Offer a filter above the list: “All | Hawkish | Neutral | Dovish” and filter based on tone classification if available from your types (if not part of FedspeakResponse, skip the filter).

GENERAL UX
- Show skeleton loaders while fetching both TrumpIndex and Fedspeak.
- Handle errors gracefully:
  - If one service fails but the other succeeds, show that section’s error state only.
  - Error card with message “Unable to load Trump Index right now” / “Unable to load Fedspeak right now” and a Retry button.

========================================
ROUTING
========================================
- Register a /policy route in App.tsx (or equivalent routing file) that renders the Policy page component.
- Add a link in the main navigation/side menu, labeled “Policy” or “Policy & Politics”, with an icon similar in style to other items (e.g., a gavel/balance/government icon if available in the icon set, or a generic chart/pulse icon otherwise).
- The route should be accessible from the main nav, consistent with Dashboard/Headlines/Earnings routes.

========================================
STATE MANAGEMENT
========================================
- Use the existing pattern for data fetching (for example React Query, SWR, or custom hooks).
- Create one or two hooks in /client/src/hooks (or equivalent):
  - useTrumpIndex()
  - useFedspeak()
  These should:
    - Call getTrumpIndex() / getFedspeak()
    - Handle loading, error, and data.
- In the Policy page, use those hooks to render the sections.

========================================
TESTS
========================================
Create tests for the Policy page using the project’s existing testing stack (Vitest/Jest + React Testing Library):

- tests:
  - Renders loading/skeleton states while data is fetching.
  - Renders Trump Index z-score and table when getTrumpIndex() resolves with mock data.
  - Renders Fedspeak tone meter and chart when getFedspeak() resolves.
  - Displays error state when getTrumpIndex() rejects.
  - Clicking “Refresh” triggers refetch (assert via mocked getTrumpIndex()).
- Use module mocking for the api client methods (mock getTrumpIndex / getFedspeak to return fixed fixtures).

========================================
STYLE & QUALITY
========================================
- Use the existing Card, Badge, Table, Heading, and layout components from the project to match the style of Dashboard, Headlines, etc.
- Keep typography and spacing consistent with other pages.
- Ensure the page looks good in both dark and light themes if the app supports theme switch.
- Make sure the layout is responsive: stacked on mobile, side-by-side where appropriate on desktop.

========================================
DONE WHEN
========================================
- /policy route appears in the nav and loads without errors.
- With mocked data for getTrumpIndex and getFedspeak, the page shows:
  - Trump Index card with current z-score & regime.
  - Z-score trend chart.
  - Sensitive assets table.
  - Trump policy news feed with topics & intensity.
  - Fedspeak tone meter & 7-day chart.
  - Fed quotes list with implied odds and links.
- All tests for the Policy page pass.
